Average energy = 0.65906
Average valence = 0.484443
Average danceability = 0.71646

I sorted the valence with DESC order and ASC order to find the middle values: 0.468 and 0.473
I then find the medium of valence by finding the average of these two values: 0.4705

I use the same method to find the medium of energy and danceability:
Medium danceability = 0.733
Medium energy = 0.678

Comparing Medium values with Mean values, I've noticed that both danceability and energy have gone up
whereus valence has gone down.

Based on research:
low energy/low valence songs are considered “sad”,
low valence/high energy ones are “angry”,
high valence and low energy are “calm”
both high values are “happy”.

This user might be angry? Energy has passed the midpoint 0.5 but valence is on the lower end.
